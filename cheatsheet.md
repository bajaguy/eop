# Elevation of Privilege Cheat Sheet
1. Draw a system model where everyone can see it.
2. Ask everyone to set aside skepticism for 15 minutes.
3. Hand out decks
4. Setup

    * State the goal: Win hands by connecting the threat on the card to the system here.  
    * Explain how to setup: We're going to play in small groups, using one deck per group.  Remove the front cards (instructions, strategy) and the back (lists of threats), so you only have threat cards, and shuffle those
    * Demo how to use a card by pulling a random card and connecting it to the system model.  Then the next player (clockwise) would play in the same suit...
    * Point out the strategy and play flowcharts for reference.
5. Play!
    * Make sure people take notes on the threats
    * Some people will play collaboratively with their hands face up in front of them, others competitively, with cards close to their chest.
