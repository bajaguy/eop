# The *Elevation of Privilege* Threat Modeling Card Deck

I created Elevation of Privilege while at Microsoft.  I'm creating this repository to have a single location for bugfixes, encourage more derivative work, and all the other goodness that a git repository can bring.

> Elevation of Privilege (EoP) is the easy way to get started threat modeling. It is designed to make threat modeling easy and accessible for developers and architects. Threat modeling is a core security practice during the design phase of the Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle (SDL). The EoP card game helps examine possible threats to software and computer system. This game is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 United States License.

There are a set of variants which I track on the threat modeling book website, https://www.threatmodelingbook.com/resources including a German translation, some online versions, an Alexa skill, and places you can obtain professionally printed cards.

# Notes and clarifications
The most complete source of information on the cards is Appendix D of _Threat Modeling: Designing for Security_.  Even if you don't have a copy of the book, you can often see the appendix via Amazon or Google "look inside" features.
